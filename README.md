Nightime image comparison

150_evframe,164_evframe,567_spalling : good crack , in image invisible to detect.

504 frame,604 evframe - too much light crack invisible in evframe, but visible in evframe.
490 frame,608 evframe   - fast movement in low light. 


** In our yolov6 training we use achor-free concept.Also we keep the Exponential moving average (EMA) of our model weights (self.ema = ModelEMA(model) if self.main_process else None)
to improve the model stability and the generalizability.
